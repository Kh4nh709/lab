# 🧪 Lab Overview

## 🎯 Objectives

- Recreate security vulnerabilities based on my personal experience and knowledge  
- Demonstrate and explore known vulnerabilities to better understand how they work  
- Practice both **offensive** (attacker) and **defensive** (blue team) techniques  
- Emphasize **hands-on learning** — learning through doing, not just reading

Each lab typically includes:

- Vulnerable source code or mock applications  
- Setup instructions (Docker or local environment)  
- Writeups and Proof of Concept (PoC) exploits  
- Fixes or mitigations, where applicable
